The Jungle Cook site is a site for creating, storing and viewing recipes. Users create accounts, log in and then are able to add their own custom recipes to the site. Once the recipes are added, the user can view them, update them or delete them. They also can browse some preloaded recipes on a separate page. The site uses localstorage to store both the user information and the user's recipes. There is also a json file of the preloaded recipes that the site can refer to. In order to add images to the user created recipes, users can enter a url for the image that they want to include and the url will be stored in localstorage. The site accesses individual recipe pages using the recipe ids. These ids are dynamically loaded into the links for viewing, editing and deleting. Based off of the special character included in the hash alongside the id, the site can display the correct recipe. 


Lily was responsible for all of the Javascript functionality. This included navigation and authentication as well as creating, editing, deleting and storing user recipes. This also included changing the nav to align with the state of the user, either logged in or not. Lily also created the pages for logging in, logging out, creating a recipe, editing a recipe, and viewing the user's recipes.
